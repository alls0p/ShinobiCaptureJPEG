## ShinobiCaptureJPEG

Still very much a work in progress. The end goal is to have a python program that can save JPEGs from Shinobi's JPEG API to a specific directory to be processed by an image processing tool such as DeepStack. 

As of now the functionality is very basic. It prompts the user for where they want to store the file, what the name of the camera is, and what the JPEG API URL for that camera is.
